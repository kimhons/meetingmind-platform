## üèõÔ∏è **Legal Framework Supporting All Use Cases**

### Universal Legal Principles

#### Self-Defense & Protection Doctrine
The fundamental right to protect oneself, one's family, and one's interests extends to evidence gathering when facing potential harm, fraud, or illegal activity. This principle applies across all legitimate use cases.

#### Evidence Preservation Rights
Parties have a recognized legal right to preserve evidence of violations, misconduct, or illegal activity. This right often supersedes general privacy expectations when documenting wrongdoing.

#### Public Policy & Public Interest
Laws should not prevent the exposure of illegal, harmful, or deceptive activity. Public policy generally favors accountability and transparency over privacy when illegal conduct is involved.

#### Necessity & Lesser Harm Doctrine
Recording violations may be legally justified when necessary to prevent greater harm, such as financial fraud, physical abuse, or institutional misconduct.

### Jurisdiction-Specific Protections

#### Whistleblower & Anti-Retaliation Laws
Most jurisdictions have laws protecting individuals who report illegal activity, often including protection for evidence gathering activities necessary to document wrongdoing.

#### Consumer Protection Laws
Consumer protection statutes often include provisions allowing documentation of deceptive or fraudulent business practices, even when such documentation involves recording.

#### Civil Rights & Anti-Discrimination Laws
Civil rights laws frequently protect evidence gathering when documenting discrimination, harassment, or other civil rights violations.

#### Professional & Fiduciary Duty Laws
Laws governing professional relationships often support documentation of breaches of fiduciary duty or professional misconduct.

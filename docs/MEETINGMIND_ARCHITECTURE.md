## 3. Hybrid AI Provider Architecture

The core of the MeetingMind platform is its innovative Hybrid AI Provider Architecture, which intelligently routes AI requests to the most appropriate provider based on factors like cost, performance, and criticality.

### 3.1. Intelligent Provider Routing

The following diagram illustrates the provider routing logic:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[AI Request] --> B{Operation Type?}
    
    B -->|Critical| C[Direct Providers]
    B -->|Standard| D[AIMLAPI Primary]
    B -->|Real-time| E[Fastest Available]
    B -->|Experimental| F[AIMLAPI Only]
    
    C --> G{Provider Health?}
    D --> H{AIMLAPI Health?}
    E --> I{Latency Check?}
    F --> H
    
    G -->|Healthy| J[OpenAI/Anthropic/Google]
    G -->|Unhealthy| K[Fallback Pool]
    
    H -->|Healthy| L[AIMLAPI Execution]
    H -->|Unhealthy| M[Direct Provider Fallback]
    
    I -->|<500ms| L
    I -->|>500ms| J
    
    J --> N[Response + Metrics]
    K --> N
    L --> N
    M --> N
    
    N --> O[Cost Tracking]
    N --> P[Performance Analytics]
    N --> Q[Health Monitoring]
    
    O --> R[Optimization Engine]
    P --> R
    Q --> R
    
    R --> S[Route Adjustment]
    S --> B
```

### 3.2. Provider Selection Matrix

| Operation Type | Primary Provider | Fallback Strategy | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Direct (OpenAI/Anthropic) | Multi-provider fallback | Real-time coaching, Enterprise demos |
| **Standard** | AIMLAPI | Direct provider backup | Meeting analysis, Knowledge integration |
| **Real-time** | AIMLAPI + Direct | Fastest available | Live coaching, Instant suggestions |
| **Experimental** | AIMLAPI | Cost-optimized only | R&D, Feature testing |
| **Batch** | AIMLAPI | Queue management | Bulk processing, Analytics |

## 4. Triple-AI Collaboration

MeetingMind employs a Triple-AI collaboration system to ensure the highest quality insights. This system leverages the strengths of three leading AI models:

*   **GPT-5:** Advanced reasoning and content generation.
*   **Claude 4.5 Sonnet:** Accuracy validation and safety.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Speed and real-time processing.
